#Intro
This repo is intended for CS290I (Computer Science for Non_Computer Science) students. It contains sample skeleton code from HW_2. An easy way to start the homework would be to fork this repo. 

## Outcomes
By the end of this HW you will be familiar with the basic object oriented programing principles applied in the Objective-C language.
## Statement

Create a “Hello User” that displays a random user name every time a button (UIButton) is clicked. The random user name will be chosen from an NSMutableArray populated with the list of 290I students names ( You can get the list from b-courses ). The random generation mechanism shall be executed by an object called my290IBrain subclassing NSObject. my290IBrain object should have the following instance method. 
-(NSString*) generateRandom290IClassStudentName;
The latter method shall be first allocated and instantiated when the view loads. Then called every time the user hits the button.
Skeleton app will be provided on b-courses.
